    /*
        To represent a file folder tree structure on the frontend,
        we can use a hierarchical data structure like a tree.


       Each node in the tree represents either a file or a folder and
       the root node represents the top-level directory and each folder node can
       have multiple child nodes, representing the files and subfolders within that folder.


Frontend Representation:
    there are several ways to perform
    1. Tree View: A tree view component is ideal for representing hierarchical data.
        Many frontend frameworks like React, Angular, Vue offer tree view components or libraries that can render this structure.
    2. Collapsible Nodes: Each folder node can be made collapsible, allowing users to expand or collapse to view its children/subfolders).
    3. Icons: Use different icons to represent files and folders to visually distinguish between them.
